What is MCABOR ?

Name
------------------------------------------
McVerry's Cointegration Algorithm Based On Relativity

Description
------------------------------------------
MCABOR is a simple cointegration calculator based on the Java language.

I wrote this to help me with building a Java based pairs trading program.  Let me know how you use it.

MCABOR How It Works
---------------------

- This is not based on any formal mathematical cointegration models such as Engleâ€“Granger, Johansen, etc.

- It takes two Java ArrayList objects containing Doubles, there must be more than one element in the lists, and equal number of elemtns, and there must be
unique minimum and maximum values.   

- iterates through both lists to find the minimum and maximum values for each.

- iterates again to compute each elements relative value to the minimum and maximum, the computed value will be 
between 0 and 1.

   * during this iteration it sums the absolute value of the difference of all of the two <u>relative</u> values based on their position.
   
- it returns the sum divided by the number of elements in the ArrayLists.

  $$( \sum_{k=1}^n abs( ( ( A_k - min(A) )  /  ( max(A)-min(A) ) )  - ( ( B_k - min(B) )  /  ( max(B) -min(B) ) ) )/ n$$ 

- return value will range between 0. to 1.0:
   
  - 0 - perfect cointegration.

  - 0.5 - complete randomness.
  
  - 1.0 - the numbers move in complete opposition to each other.

Sample Code
-----------

```java

import org.mcabor.Cointegration;

...
ArrayList<Double> firstArray = new ArrayList<>();
for (var in:sourceData1)
  firstArray.add(in);

ArrayList<Double> secondArray = new ArrayList<>();
for (var in:sourceData2)
  secondArray.add(in);

...
 try{
 var rank = Cointegration.cointegration(firstArray, secondArray);
 if (rank > .05)
	continue;  // we want a return value below or equal to .95
  }
  catch (Exception e)
  {
     e.printStackTrace();
     return;
  }

// do something

```
